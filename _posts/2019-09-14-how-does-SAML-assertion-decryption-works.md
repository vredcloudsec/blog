### The Comprehensive Guide to Decrypting SAML Assertions: An In-depth Technical Exploration

---

**1. The Anatomy of Encrypted Assertions**

Diving straight in, encrypted SAML assertions are typically encapsulated within the `<EncryptedAssertion>` XML element. Two critical components to look out for:

- `<EncryptedData>`: The encrypted assertion data.
- `<EncryptedKey>`: Contains the symmetric session key, encrypted using the recipient's public key.

---

**2. Deciphering the Encrypted Session Key**

Before we can decrypt the assertion data, we first need to decrypt the session key from the `<EncryptedKey>` element, which is encrypted asymmetrically.

**Python Code Example using xmlsec library**:
```python
import xmlsec

# Load the SP's private key
key = xmlsec.Key.from_file("sp_private_key.pem", xmlsec.KeyFormat.PEM)

# Parse the SAML Response to extract the EncryptedKey
tree = xmlsec.tree.parse_file("saml_response.xml")
encrypted_key_node = xmlsec.tree.find_node(tree, xmlsec.Node.ENCRYPTED_KEY)

# Decrypt the EncryptedKey
session_key = xmlsec.encrypted_key_decrypt(encrypted_key_node, key)
```

---

**3. Assertion Data Decryption Using the Session Key**

With the session key in hand, it's time to decrypt the actual assertion data.

**Python Code Example**:
```python
# Locate the EncryptedData node
encrypted_data_node = xmlsec.tree.find_node(tree, xmlsec.Node.ENCRYPTED_DATA)

# Decrypt the assertion
decrypted_assertion = xmlsec.encrypted_data_decrypt(encrypted_data_node, session_key)
```

---

**4. XML Canonicalization and Parsing**

Once decrypted, the XML might need canonicalization to iron out any inconsistencies.

**Python Code Example using lxml**:
```python
from lxml import etree

# Parse the decrypted XML
root = etree.fromstring(decrypted_assertion)
canonicalized_xml = etree.tostring(root, method="c14n")
```

---

**5. Verification of Decrypted Assertion**

To ascertain the assertion's integrity post-decryption, it's essential to verify it against its XML signature.

**Python Code Example using xmlsec**:
```python
# Load the IdP's public key
idp_pub_key = xmlsec.Key.from_file("idp_public_key.pem", xmlsec.KeyFormat.PEM)

# Verify the signature
signature_node = xmlsec.tree.find_node(tree, xmlsec.Node.SIGNATURE)
verified = xmlsec.signature_verify(signature_node, idp_pub_key)
```

---

**6. Parsing Attributes from the Decrypted Assertion**

The decrypted assertion houses a treasure trove of data.

**Python Code Example using lxml**:
```python
# Extract attributes
attributes = root.findall(".//{urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion}Attribute")
for attr in attributes:
    name = attr.get("Name")
    values = [e.text for e in attr.findall("{urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion}AttributeValue")]
    print(f"Attribute Name: {name}, Values: {values}")
```

**7. Common Pitfalls and Best Practices**

- **Key Management**: Ensure private keys are stored securely, away from prying eyes.
  
- **Algorithm Choices**: Stick to proven cryptographic algorithms like AES and RSA. Avoid deprecated algorithms.
  
- **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle decryption errors gracefully. This could be due to key mismatches, data tampering, or other anomalies.

---

**8. Keeping Up with SAML Protocol Enhancements**

The SAML protocol isn't static. With new versions and updates, decryption methodologies might undergo subtle changes. It's paramount to stay updated with the latest SAML specifications and incorporate necessary changes in the decryption routines.

---

**Conclusion**

Decrypting SAML assertions might seem daunting initially, but with a systematic approach and the right tools, it's a breeze. The combination of understanding the underlying XML structure and leveraging specialized libraries makes the process efficient and secure. Always remember, in the world of cryptography, vigilance and adherence to best practices are key.
