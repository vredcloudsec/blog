## General Notes



### I'm really excited to chat with anyone who's interested in these topics I love:

1. **Content on the Site, Including Feedback on Articles**: If you have come across any content on my site, particularly articles I have authored, your thoughts, impressions, critiques, and feedback are not only welcomed but highly encouraged. Your perspective can provide invaluable insights, whether it be praise for something you found engaging or constructive criticism on areas where I might improve. I am genuinely eager to understand your viewpoint and learn from your unique experience with my work.

2. **Suggestions for Topics to Explore Further**: Perhaps you have specific subjects, queries, or themes that you wish me to delve into with greater depth. Your suggestions and curiosities can guide me towards exploring areas that resonate with you, the reader, and I am more than willing to dedicate time and effort to investigate and present insights on those topics.

3. **Discussion Regarding My Open Source Software (OSS) Projects**: If you have interest, questions, or opinions about any of my open-source endeavors, your engagement is most welcome. Whether you wish to learn more, provide your own insights, or even collaborate, I am open to fostering a conversation that may lead to innovation and mutual growth.

4. **Sharing Insights on New IAM/Cloud Security Technologies**: The ever-evolving field of Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Cloud Security holds a special interest for me. Should you have knowledge, experience, or curiosity about the latest advancements, trends, or best practices within these areas, I would be thrilled to discuss, learn, and possibly collaborate on these subjects.

5. **Career Development Conversations**: If you're seeking guidance, opinions, or merely a thoughtful conversation about career development within the technology field, I am here to listen, share my experiences, and provide support that may assist you in your professional journey.

6. **Any Other Topics of Interest to Me**: Lastly, if you follow or know me, you're likely aware of various other subjects that fascinate me. Any discussions, inquiries, or thoughts on these topics would make for engaging and fruitful dialogue.

In essence, I strive to foster an environment where communication thrives, and collaboration is nurtured. Your engagement in these areas or any others that align with my interests would not only be appreciated but enthusiastically embraced. Feel free to reach out, knowing that your thoughts and inquiries are highly valued and will be met with genuine interest and responsiveness.


### Communication Types I Will Likely Ignore and Disregard

I feel it is essential to clarify that there are specific types of communication that I will most likely disregard and not engage with, due to various reasons. These include:

1. **Messages from Random Recruiters Interested in Non-Existent Skills**: I often receive communications from recruiters who appear to be randomly reaching out with interest in skills I do not possess, specifically pertaining to React.js and other peripheral technology abilities. These skills are not part of my repertoire, and any outreach related to them will likely be met with indifference.

2. **Inquiries About "Guest" Articles from Marketing Agencies**: I frequently encounter proposals and requests from marketing agencies seeking to place "guest" articles on my platform. These often seem to be more aligned with promotional or advertising objectives rather than contributing genuine value or insight. Therefore, such solicitations are typically ignored.

3. **Hostile and Non-Constructive Messages**: Respectful and constructive dialogue is something I value highly. Hence, any communications that are infused with hostility or that lack a constructive tone are not conducive to meaningful engagement, and I generally choose to disregard them.

4. **Sales Pitches for Random Services**: Experience has taught me that unsolicited sales pitches, especially those arriving via cold emails from sales representatives, rarely align with my needs or interests. I have never previously been persuaded to purchase a service or product through such methods, so any effort spent in attempting to market random services to me would likely be futile and not result in a successful transaction.

In summary, I believe in fostering meaningful and relevant connections and engagements. Therefore, any communications falling into the aforementioned categories are unlikely to receive my attention or response, as they do not align with my interests or values. It is advisable to be aware of these preferences to avoid unnecessary expenditure of time and effort in reaching out to me on these subjects.

## How to Reach Me

Want to get in touch? Here's how:

**Email's the Way**: I love email. It's easy, fast, and my favorite way to chat. If you need to reach me, shoot me an email.

**Not So Much Social Media**: I don't really check social media much. They're not my thing, so email's your best bet.

**More Details Below**: You'll find more info below, like my email address and the best times to catch me. Can't wait to hear from you! Feel free to drop me a line anytime.

### Email

Feel free to contact me at `venkat` at `iamsecure.dev` about anything.
Email is a great place for private constructive conversations. It's also a great
option to discuss my open-source projects, if you're the type of person who avoids
using GitHub.


### GitHub

The best place to collaborate on any of my OSS projects is GitHub. I welcome all
contributions, no matter how small they are. I also try to help all contributors
with feedback and guidance.



### LinkedIn

I usually accept LinkedIn connections but rarely reply to messages there. If you want to reach me, email's your best bet; it's way more effective.
