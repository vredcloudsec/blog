## General Notes

I'd be really glad to hear from you, if you want to talk
about:

* content on the site (e.g. share some feedback about an article I wrote)
* Provide any topics you want me to explore further
* any of my OSS projects
* Any new IAM / Cloud Security technlogies you would like to share.
* career development
* any topic that is of interest to me (if you know/follow me, you definitely know what they are)

I'll likely ignore messages:

* from random recruiters who are interested in my (non-existing) React.js and other periphery technology skills.
* about "guest" articles from marketing agencies
* that are hostile and non-constructive
* that are sales pitches for random services (I've never bought into a service after a cold email from a sales rep, so don't waste your time with me)

## Getting in Touch

The best way to reach me is via email. I love email and rarely bother to check
messages on LinkedIn (and social media in general). More details below.

### Email

Feel free to contact me at `first name` at `iamsecure.dev` about anything.
Email is a great place for private constructive conversations. It's also a great
option to discuss my open-source projects, if you're the type of person who avoids
using GitHub.


### GitHub

The best place to collaborate on any of my OSS projects is GitHub. I welcome all
contributions, no matter how small they are. I also try to help all contributors
with feedback and guidance.



### Blog Comments

For reasons that I will mention in a future post I've removed comments from this blog.



### LinkedIn

I accept most invitations to connect, but I rarely respond to any messages there.
If you want to get my attention on LinkedIn you'll have to try really hard. Emails
work a lot better!
